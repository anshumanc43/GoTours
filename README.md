# GoTours Server
A fullstack web dev project with the MERN stack.
This is the backend for my website GoTours. The project is still under development. Check out the front end at: https://github.com/anshumanc43/GoTours
Keep in mind you have to setup your own keys for GoogleOAuth and Google Places API to work.
Instructions:
1. Clone this repo.
2. Clone the client side and place the folder in the root of this repo.
3. Do NPM installs for both.
4. Create keys.js in root/config and add your api keys.
